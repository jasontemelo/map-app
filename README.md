Project Name: MAP APP

Goal: To showcase my ability to use AJAX to pull data from APIs (in this case, the Geolocation API)

Description: In one of my learning courses (Jonas Schmetmann's Udemy Course on JavaScript), I acquired the skills need to build an app that shows the user's current location on the map and add pins that indicate where the user completed workouts (running or cycling).
